permalink: /publication/2022-08-10-it-affordances-and-consumption-values-perspective-for-the-use-of-social-commerce
excerpt: "Social commerce is growing throughout the world. This paper develops a framework based on affordance theory and theory of consumption values to understand which consumption values motivate feature-enabled affordances to satisfy buyers and sellers and how that impacts the overall transactional experience on the platform. Additionally, the paper also fills the gap in the literature regarding seller's selling behavior which is relatively understudied. The study focuses on Facebook Marketplace as the online social commerce platform (OSC). This research will help system designers to design better social commerce platforms and identify features that need improvement or changes. Additionally, the findings from this research will create a better understanding of buyer and seller behavior and their motivations of using social commerce platforms."
