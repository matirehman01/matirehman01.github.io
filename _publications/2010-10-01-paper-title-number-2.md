excerpt: 'The e-commerce market continues to grow, and as more and more information is available to
consumers, the way they interact with technology is changing. Various online social commerce
(OSC) platforms are available to users, such as WeChat and Facebook. Our study focuses on
Facebook and, more specifically, Facebook Marketplace which is most often used for resale of
pre-owned products. According to CNET, in 2018, Facebook Marketplace was being used in 70
countries, by 800 million people monthly. (Al-Heeti, 2018; Mac, 2017).
Our study aims to measure IT affordance in Facebook Marketplace and how affordance created
by the interaction of users and platform features promote purchase intention and seller's sale
intention. We aim to develop an IT affordance measure based on the framework by Rice et al.
(2017). We will create new seller-side IT affordance measures and build on and contextualize the
measures by Ünlüsoy et al. (2021), Dong, Wang & Benbasat (2016), and Boyd (2010) for buyer
side affordance. Furthermore, we will use IT affordance to understand the role of various
platform features and how they impact purchase intention and seller sale intention.
There have been attempts to develop IT affordance constructs for OSC in the literature, but they
are not suited to Facebook Marketplace. Some of the constructs do not apply as different
features on other platforms are not generalizable. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, the
IS affordance literature has only focused on the buyer and not the seller or their interactions.
Furthermore, the measures have not focused on OSC platforms for pre-owned products where
most users are not professional sellers but occasionally sell various used products locally.'
