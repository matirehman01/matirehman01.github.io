Hi! Iâ€™m Mati, a Ph.D. student in [Information Systems at Ivy College of Business, Iowa State University](https://www.ivybusiness.iastate.edu/directory/mati/). My research focuses on examining how users interact with technological platforms, such as Facebook Marketplace and AI-based decision-making services. Through the use of both qualitative and quantitative methods, I investigate the decision-making processes of individuals, exploring the impact of various human characteristics on user behavior and response.

By uncovering the biases and hindrances of AI and technology use, my research provides valuable insights that can enhance user experiences and promote better applications of new technology. Ultimately, my work seeks to shed light on the complex interplay between human decision-making and technology, offering significant implications for the design and implementation of new platforms.
