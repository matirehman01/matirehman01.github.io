2019	"Healthcare 4.0: Trends, Challenges and Benefits"	ACIS 2019 Proceedings	"The Fourth Industry Revolution, known as Industry 4.0, refers to the forces that are transforming industry, including the healthcare industry, where it has been termed Healthcare 4.0. Though lagging other industries in the adoption of new innovative technologies, the healthcare industry is embracing the potential benefits that arise from new innovative technologies. New trends revealed both in the academic literature and by industry practice show that researchers and practitioners are becoming more aware of the benefits technology can bring to an industry as complex as the healthcare industry. The object of the study is to identify the challenges, trends and gaps in the existing body of research with regard to Healthcare 4.0. In this study, a systematic literature review on Healthcare 4.0 research papers was conducted to identify trends, challenges and the perceived benefits that may arise from it. This paper found that there is a need to conduct more empirical studies in this area. It, further, identified the need to implement practical procedures in the industry to get feedback from patients and healthcare participants in order to promote the adoption of new Healthcare 4.0 technologies"	"Rehman, Mati Ur; Andargoli, Amirhossein Eslami; and Pousti, Hamid, ""Healthcare 4.0: Trends, Challenges and Benefits"" (2019).

2021	IT Affordances and Social Commerce: Used Product Marketplace	ICIS 2021 TREOs	"The e-commerce market continues to grow, and as more and more information is available to
consumers, the way they interact with technology is changing. Various online social commerce
(OSC) platforms are available to users, such as WeChat and Facebook. Our study focuses on
Facebook and, more specifically, Facebook Marketplace which is most often used for resale of
pre-owned products. According to CNET, in 2018, Facebook Marketplace was being used in 70
countries, by 800 million people monthly. (Al-Heeti, 2018; Mac, 2017).
Our study aims to measure IT affordance in Facebook Marketplace and how affordance created
by the interaction of users and platform features promote purchase intention and seller's sale
intention. We aim to develop an IT affordance measure based on the framework by Rice et al.
(2017). We will create new seller-side IT affordance measures and build on and contextualize the
measures by Ünlüsoy et al. (2021), Dong, Wang & Benbasat (2016), and Boyd (2010) for buyer
side affordance. Furthermore, we will use IT affordance to understand the role of various
platform features and how they impact purchase intention and seller sale intention.
There have been attempts to develop IT affordance constructs for OSC in the literature, but they
are not suited to Facebook Marketplace. Some of the constructs do not apply as different
features on other platforms are not generalizable. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, the
IS affordance literature has only focused on the buyer and not the seller or their interactions.
Furthermore, the measures have not focused on OSC platforms for pre-owned products where
most users are not professional sellers but occasionally sell various used products locally."	"Ur Rehman, Mati and Nilakanta, Sree, ""IT Affordances and Social Commerce: Used Product Marketplace"" (2021). ICIS 2021 TREOs. 63.

2022	IT Affordances and Consumption Values Perspective for the Use of Social Commerce	AMCIS 2022 Proceedings	"Social commerce is growing throughout the world. This paper develops a framework based on affordance theory and theory of consumption values to understand which consumption values motivate feature-enabled affordances to satisfy buyers and sellers and how that impacts the overall transactional experience on the platform. Additionally, the paper also fills the gap in the literature regarding seller's selling behavior which is relatively understudied. The study focuses on Facebook Marketplace as the online social commerce platform (OSC). This research will help system designers to design better social commerce platforms and identify features that need improvement or changes. Additionally, the findings from this research will create a better understanding of buyer and seller behavior and their motivations of using social commerce platforms."
